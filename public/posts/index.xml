      <description>This is the story of how this blog came to be!
I previously ran a blog which works very similarly to this one, you write up your blog in MD and then it renders as HTML. This site works exactly the same way however, it is a hell of a lot faster at doing so!
I&amp;rsquo;m using a framework called Hugo and you can get the source code of this blog over here.</description>
