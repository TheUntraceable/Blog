This is the story of how this blog came to be!

I previously ran a blog which works very similarly to this one, you write up your blog in MD and then it renders as HTML.
This site works exactly the same way however, it is a hell of a lot faster at doing so!

I'm using a framework called [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and you can get the source code of this blog over [here](https://github.com/itsnotrin/blog).

I'm planning on posting mostly the same content as before, my thoughts on some new popular coding project / trend, my thought process on code that I work on, issues I come across and general things I feel like sharing!

I understand that this is not for everyone and that's completely fine, you don't **have** to read my blog, but I will continue to make it anyway!

Apologies for the short post but I promise there is more coming soon ðŸ‘€.

Stay Frosty ;)
