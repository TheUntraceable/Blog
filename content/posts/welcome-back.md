# Hi :3,
I really don't know where to begin with this or even how to phrase anything- it's been a long long time (almost 2 years now). 

I know that no-one really followed this regardless but it still felt like a place I could talk about anything judgement free.

After my police case and other iffy home life issues I feel like I'm in a place again to get going with this again.

I'm still not in the best place mentally but I'm hoping this will help, if it doesn't then at least it'll be a cute memory of me, or so I hope.

I've still got so much to talk about- all the new things I'm running on my server, what I'm aiming for now and all the cool little projects I want to get doing, at least this way I might hold myself accountable and finish them off.

Out for now
- Rin :3

PS: Thoughts on adding an Oneko to the site? (A little cat that follows your cursor, I'm considering it bc it's kinda cute :3 )
