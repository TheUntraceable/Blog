# Who are you when you're alone?
I was listening to a [song titled `Who are you when you're alone` today](https://open.spotify.com/track/3xfFUgzcxiGBHHBTKO4ECH?si=4e3b189ffd1f48f7) and it got me thinking, who are we actually when we're alone? What defines us as people?

## What defines us as people?
This is such an open-ended question that I don't know quite where to begin. Are we defined by the facade we put on, pretending to be happy? Are we defined by the results we get in School / College? Are we defined by what we listen to?

Trying to define yourself is, in my opinion, an endless trap that will harm you more than help you.

## So... who are we when we're alone?
First off, how dare you ask the question I asked you first ðŸ™„. Second off, how do we define alone here too?

I'm not talking about 'alone' where you've still got your phone next to you which could, at some point, go off. I'm not talking about 'alone' where you're out somewhere but by yourself.

I mean alone alone. Just you, maybe some music, maybe laying in bed, staring at the ceiling or the walls or sat in a chair doing the same. Just... you, nothing going on, just you.

Who are we in those moments. The hardest moments in our lives, those moments where we're doubting if we should even be here.

## Where do we go?
Where does your mind lead you off to? What do you think of? Life can become so difficult for us so quickly but it's a matter of finding a way to cope... whether that be not the 'best' coping mechanisms or something that is good for you, you have to find a way to work through it rather than around it.

## What about me?
Honestly, I don't know :3. Every day is becoming more and more difficult. Yeah, "go to your friends" works up until a point. You'll affect them eventually and feel even worse, it's not worth it to me.

If I let the facade fall through, I hurt those around me. If I keep up the facade, I keep hurting myself.

If I push through it, I'm good again for a month, maybe 2 or even 3? But it's not worth it for the pain that comes again after.

It gets more and more tiring working my way through it every day but all I can do is hope that it'll pay off sooner or later, but that hope dwindles further and further everyday. After all, who would notice one light going out in a sky of stars.
